			<h3>Temporary Blue (5)</h3>
			<p>Print ads for the Temporary.Blue collection featuring <i>Power</i> (Foreground) and <i>Anti</i>

				The next 5 designs are all part of this collection. Each text space is filled with excerpts from
				my favorite books and or short stories. Here, one can enjoy Franz Kafka's <i>Metamorphasis</i>.</p>

			<p><b>LIVEINEVERYNOW.</b> is a brand I created as a reminder to be present in my life.

			video, and additional content at a high level. This is a print mockup

			<h3>Freebie Brand Breakdown</h3>
			<p>Freebie is a concept brand that was initially conceptualized as an IOS App to serve as a directory of
				free things in one's area. We targeted students and planned to scale through universities using event
				directories for the school year. We didn't end up pursuing this concept, however, the branding was
				finished and is a structured example of my brand understanding and development.</p>

			<h3 >EDSO Logo</h3>
			<p>EDSO (Edgy-Sophisticated) is a women's fashion brand that offers additional editorial on site that strongly supports
			themes of women empowerement, individualism, and high fashion. I feel the logo I designed captures all of these ideas.
			The shape is abstract to represent individualism. Moreover, it is reminiscent of both a pair of women's
			heels - fashion - and a naked women laying down - appreciation of female body/women empowerement. Lastly, the Serif font
			coupled with the abstract logo design, bring home the idea of "Edgy-Sophisticated."</p>

		<div class="project" id="CAPUSULATE">
			<img src="img/Capsulate_insta_final.jpg" alt="test">
			<h3>Capsulate Logo</h3>
			<p>Capsulate is the first successful web-app launched under <b>LIVEINEVERYNOW.</b> The idea is on brand
				with <b>LIVEINEVERYNOW.</b> in that it actively supports the idea of living in the present/now. Capuslate's core function
				is a photo-memoir app. It encourages users to take one picture every day that acknowledges the beauty in their day.
				The photos are then collected in a scalable display, in hopes that one can look back at everyday of their year and
				feel that each day was different and not a "blur". The logo is new and fresh like all new start-ups lol but also a
				floating time capsule, as Capsulate hopes to embody a digital time capsule of daily beauty.
